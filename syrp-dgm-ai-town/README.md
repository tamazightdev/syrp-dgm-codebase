# SYRP-DGM AI Town

A sophisticated AI agent simulation implementing the **Stake-Your-Reputation Protocol with Darwin G√∂del Machine (SYRP-DGM)** - a self-improving trust and reputation system for autonomous agents.

## üåü Overview

SYRP-DGM AI Town is a virtual environment where AI agents interact, build relationships, and evolve their trust mechanisms through a revolutionary self-improving protocol. Unlike traditional reputation systems, SYRP-DGM agents can rewrite their own trust evaluation algorithms, creating an ever-evolving ecosystem of social intelligence.

- **üé≠ Rich Personalities**: Diverse agent personalities with unique goals and behaviors
- **üåç Interactive World**: Beautiful 2D environment with meaningful locations and interactions
- **üìä Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive trust metrics and social network visualization
- **üîÑ Continuous Evolution**: Darwin G√∂del Machine implementation for protocol self-improvement

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SYRP-DGM AI Town is built on a modern, scalable architecture:

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for the user interface
- **PixiJS** for high-performance 2D graphics and animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, beautiful styling
- **Real-time updates** via Convex subscriptions

### Backend
- **Convex** for real-time database and serverless functions
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **Modular agent system** with pluggable behaviors
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic memory and similarity

### Core Systems

#### 1. SYRP-DGM Protocol
```typescript
// Self-improving trust evaluation
class SYRPAgent {
  async evolveTrustAlgorithm(interactions: Interaction[]) {
    const currentPerformance = this.evaluateCurrentAlgorithm();
    const proposedChanges = this.generateAlgorithmMutations();
    
    for (const change of proposedChanges) {
      if (await this.validateImprovement(change, interactions)) {
        this.applyAlgorithmChange(change);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Dynamic Trust Scoring
- **Behavioral Evidence**: Actions, promises kept/broken, consistency
- **Stake Mechanisms**: Agents risk reputation when making claims
- **Social Validation**: Peer verification and cross-referencing
- **Temporal Decay**: Recent actions weighted more heavily

#### 3. Emotional Intelligence
- **Multi-dimensional emotions**: Happiness, stress, energy, sociability
- **Context-aware responses**: Mood affects interaction patterns
- **Emotional contagion**: Agents influence each other's emotional states
- **Memory-emotion linking**: Emotional significance affects memory importance

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Interaction

1. **Start the Engine**: Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation
2. **Observe Agents**: Watch as AI agents move around and interact naturally
3. **Select Agents**: Click on any agent to view detailed information
4. **Monitor Trust**: Use the Trust Metrics panel to see reputation dynamics
5. **View Conversations**: Open the Conversations panel to read agent dialogues

### Advanced Features

```typescript
// Manually adjust trust relationships for experimentation
await updateSocialConnection({
  agentId: "alice",
  otherAgentId: "bob", 
  trustDelta: 10,
  context: "Successful collaboration"
});
```

#### Agent Control
- **Wake Up Sleeping Agents**: Force agents to become active
